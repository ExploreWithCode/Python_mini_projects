These files let you keep track of the day on different celestial bodies.
The time is calculated based on the synodic rotation period, because that is what we use here on earth too. 
The synodic and sidereal are not the same thing.

A celestial body is not added here when: 
⨀ its synodic rotation period is unknown
⨀ or it's synchronous
⨀ or there isn't reliable information regarding it
